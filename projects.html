			<p>My scientific interests are, I think, pretty broad. I was
				almost exclusively interested in astronomy and astrophysics when I
				entered college, but I slowly developed a taste for other areas of
				physics. I am active in several different fields of energy modeling
				and simulation as well as quantum computing and information, kinetic
				theory and data mining.</p>

			<p>
				I am the lead architect, developer and principal investigator of the
				<a href="http://niceproject.sourceforge.net">NEAMS Integrated
					Computational Environment (NiCE) </a>for the US Department of Energy's
				Advanced Modeling and Simulation Office in the Office of Nuclear
				Energy. The primary goal of NiCE is to create a unified, integrated
				and dynamically reconfigurable environment in which analysts and
				developers can perform modeling and simulation tasks without having
				to fight with command line tools or hacked-together utilities. This
				project has many research challenges, the most important of which is
				the development of a single "workflow engine" that easily handle all
				sorts of different tasks - from problem setup to data analysis - for
				many different fields.
			</p>

			<p>In addition to the development of new modeling and simulation
				capabilities, NiCE is directly responsible for a new branch of my
				research program in the area of nuclear simulation data mining.
				After working with simple post-processing tools for nuclear
				simulation results, my team and I worked to apply data mining and
				anomaly detection techniques to nuclear data in a scalable way. This
				is an exciting development with some success (two papers, some
				talks) and I’m looking forward to its development in the future.</p>

			<p>I learned about quantum computing and information as an
				undergraduate and had the opportunity to work in the field a couple
				of years ago with some colleagues at the Lab. My team and I worked
				with those colleagues to develop a simulator for adiabatic quantum
				computers and we are currently researching ways that they simulator
				can be used to simulate these systems for large numbers of cubits.
				(>40 cubits is large for a simulation and some systems available
				commercially have 512 cubits.)</p>

			<p>
				My newest project is the <a
					href="https://sourceforge.net/p/xolotl-psi">Xolotl
					Plasma-Surface Interactions simulator</a> that is under development for
				the U.S. Department of Energy’s Scientific Computing through
				Advanced Computing program. This project is developing a brand new
				high-performance computing simulator for investigating the
				interfaces between plasmas and surfaces in tokamaks and linear
				fusion devices to determine the damage due to Helium irradiation of
				the bulk. In addition to the computational physics research, my team
				and I are also investing a large amount of effort into determining
				the best ways to embed performance monitoring and visualization
				technologies into the software. We are also doing research to
				determine the best techniques for quantifying the uncertainty in
				Xolotl’s results so that it can be compared directly to experiment.
			</p>

			<p>I am still active in astrophysics when I have time to spare
				from all of these other activities. I no longer research colliding
				galaxies, but I do continue to work with the joint UTK+ORNL
				astrophysics group to investigate novel methods for solving reaction
				networks (“kinetic theory”). Over the past decade or so we have
				developed and published on several new algorithms that allow
				extremely stiff systems of equations to be integrated explicitly by
				exploiting the underlying physics and making appropriate
				approximations.</p>

			<p>As a perennially curious man, I am always adding new things to
				my plate and looking for opportunities to collaborate to answer
				meaningful and exciting questions.</p>
