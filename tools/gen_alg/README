This code can be compiled by typing "gcc -c gen_alg.c." Some 
example are provided in the makefile and can be compiled by
typing "make <test>" where <test> is 1D_poly, 2D_gaussian, or
2D_sinxbyx.

This code is a genetic algorithm and can be used to maximize or
minimize functions. The code is largely based on Pikaia with 
some changes made to suit the author's tastes.

To call the function,

			gen_alg(n,x,ctrl,fit_func)

where 

		n = an integer number of dimensions of the vector x
                x = an array of floats, size n
                ctrl = control variables
			ctrl[0] = # population members
			ctrl[1] = # generations
			ctrl[2] = crossover type, 0 = single-point
			          1 = two-point,
			          2 = multi-point
			ctrl[3] = birth rate
			ctrl[4] = mutation rate
