		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			<p>I hold a Bachelor of Science from Virginia Tech and a Master
				of Science from the University of Tennessee, both of which are in
				physics. I have undergraduate minors in astronomy and mathematics.</p>

			<p>I spent a lot of time in physics labs as an undergraduate at
				VT and worked on neutrino, ultra-cold neutron and material
				characterization projects in addition to spending nearly every free
				hour of my senior year either behind a telescope or rebuilding one.
				As a graduate student at UTK, I split my time between my regular
				course work, organizing and leading the astronomy labs (which meant
				building even more telescopes!) and working on my thesis with the
				joint UTK+ORNL astrophysics group. My M.S. thesis, "Optimization of
				Cosmological Simulations with Artificial Intelligence," was accepted
				in December 2007 and focused on the development of
				proof-of-principle software for optimizing the final configuration
				of simulated galaxy collisions with feed-forward back-propagating
				artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms.</p>
