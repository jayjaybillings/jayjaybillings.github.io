This update implements the proper iterative solution for finding the disk scale length instead of using the 15% approximation, [MMW,98].

This update also adjusts the bounds on the integrator to work with certain parameters.

Steven Boada found a bug where the code tried to look beyond the edge of the dispersion grid and caused a segmentation fault. 

Several other bugs have been noticed and fixed by the author. 

The most notable change in the release is the removal of user-controlled random numbers. Starscream manages those on its own now.

Dowon, a user, just identified a bug where the code compiles but crashes with a segmentation fault while running the test case.

This bug can be fixed by changing the size of the "green" and "potential" arrays in starscream_init.c to "double" from "double *" or by 
downloading a new version of the code.

Just identified a bug when trying to create disks for large m_d, j_d, and lambda where the GSL qags integration routine fails to converge.

This can be fixed by changing the tolerance in the calls to the QAGS routines from 0.0 to something like 1.0E-20 or downloading a new version of the code.
